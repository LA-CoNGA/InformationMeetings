Three main modules:

I) Research-engineering course

    I.1) Mainly based on the Turing course
    
II) Statistics

    II.1) must be a mix of formalism and practices
    
    II.2) A chapter on Machine learning has been added, mandatory for all students
    
    II.3) simplify a bit the advanced topics (more suitable for optional courses and/or for the internships)
    
III) Hands-on projects

   III.1)  we should aim have a limited number of projects: one or two physics-oriented (LHC+other?), one more data-science oriented
   
   III.2) example from the LHC project :  , we could propose a two'step study: 1st evaluate performance of the objects needed for a physics analysis (i.e. lepton efficiencies, fake-rates, etc...) 2nd measure a physics observable, i.e. a cross-section, a 95% CL limit...

On manpower :

We probably need 3 teachers; one more theory-oriented, one more ML-oriented, and a person in charge of the environment for the notebooks. Another possibility mentioned would be to have a pool of a few teachers fully responsible for independent pico-modules (n.b. the pico-module logic would better fit in the "Instrumentation/Detector" or "Theory" subgroups).

Very important :

We need to insert all these discussions into a calendar!
