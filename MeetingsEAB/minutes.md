1st meeting with our External Advisory Board (EAB)

Attendants: 
Leticia Cugliandolo (Sorbonne Universit√©), Silvia Torres (UNAM), Tere Dova (La Plata), Fernando Quevedo (Cambridge), Salvatore Mele (CERN)

The slides shown during the meeting are attached in this repo.

A few excerpts from the discussion:
1) We should improve the material available on our web page, as of today it does not easily reflect the actual status of the project
2) For the arguments in support of our longer-term sustainability plans, we should quote some key figures like the actual cost per student, which seems to be quite good.
