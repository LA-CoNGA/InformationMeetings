* Project keys: consortium, responsibility and accountability

* Communication and media presence is essential. Reports for each WP are essential.

* Partnership agreement:

  * Uno con cada universidad. Less than 6 months to sign it

  * Esperando un draft de la EACEA. Revisión de UdP y luego envío a los partners

  * Follow-up:

    * Contact your universities. The partnership agreement is coming

     * José and Reina will follow up at UdP

* Kick-off meeting:

  * Setup bilateral sessions with the authorities in each university. Reina, José and LN will be available and happy to discuss with them

* Co-funding from partners universities

  * In the form of administrative or technical form only. Infrastructure does not count.

  * This needs to be defined in the partnership agreement

* Accreditations and visibility

  * How can we do to include this into our university programs?  New curriculum will not be considered if not accreditated 

  * Approach the accreditation associations in each country

  * You need to be visible, you need to make the project visible at the local and national level: media, presentations at your university

* Impact:

  * We need to increase the number of students. Having only 1-2 students per university will not be enough. 

  * Start contacting students asap. Can we start partnership with other universities? This is delicate because we can not use the money for internships for students not registered officially in the partner institutions. Ideas? Solution might be country dependent!

  * The involvement of industrial, economic and social partners is key. We need to involve them as much as possible. Organise a talk/seminar with industrial partners. 

* Equipment:

  * We need to buy them in the next 48 months. We need the buying order before June

  * The equipment is property of the institutions. We can use this point as leverage in our discussions with the university authorities 

* Reports:

  * From month 1 to 18month

  * From month 1 to end of the project

  * Plus all the internal reports that we described in the project proposal
  
* To do:
  * Watch the videos! Read the material. We all need to have all the information at hand. We need a common speech!
